# Acoustic Extinguisher Fire Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the effectiveness of fire extinguishing using acoustic signals. It leverages machine learning to analyze acoustic data and classify extinguisher performance as either a success or failure. The dataset includes various features like size, fuel type, distance, decibel level, airflow, and frequency, which contribute to understanding how these factors impact fire extinguishing outcomes.

## Dataset Information
- **Features**: `SIZE`, `FUEL`, `DISTANCE`, `DESIBEL`, `AIRFLOW`, `FREQUENCY`
- **Target**: `STATUS` (Binary - success or failure)
- **Source**: Dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/acoustic-extinguisher-fire-dataset)

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distribution, relationships, and key patterns.
3. **Modeling**: Building and tuning classification models to predict the `STATUS` of fire extinguishing.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
